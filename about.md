### Why i didn't extract the data from the cache of the pivot table
The only way that i know that i can extract cache from pivot tables is if the file is in the `.xlsx` format, so i decided that it would be better to get the data directly from the ANP's website, rather than manually converting the file (since using python would ruin the cached data) so i can be up to date with the most recent files.
